# Strength Properties of High Strength Fiber Reinforced Concrete With Partial Replacement of Cement by Silica Fume. 
## 📍 Abstract
This project investigates the mechanical performance of High Strength Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HSFRC) by partially replacing cement with Silica Fume and adding Steel Fibers to improve tensile and flexural characteristics of concrete. Silica Fume is used in proportions of 8%, 12%, and 15% by weight of cement to determine the optimum percentage. Based on the optimal mix, Steel Fibers with aspect ratios 25 and 50 are added at 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0% by weight of cement. Strength tests such as Compressive Strength, Split Tensile Strength, and Flexural Strength were conducted. The results showed significant improvement in mechanical properties due to the pozzolanic reaction of Silica Fume and crack-bridging action of Steel Fibers.

## 🎯 Objective
- To study the effect of Silica Fume as a partial cement replacement on strength properties of concrete.
- To determine the optimum Silica Fume content for high strength concrete.
